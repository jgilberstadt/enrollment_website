    <p style="font-size:18px;"><a name="section3-3">3.3   Exclusion criteria (subjects meeting any one of these criteria will be excluded):</a></p>
    <p>• Current participation in another clinical treatment trial with an investigational agent.</p>
    <p>• Any condition that may interfere with the subject’s ability to perform pulmonary function testing.</p>
    <p>• Known allergy or hypersensitivity to pharmacologic agents used during ECP</p>
    <p>• Any condition that would significantly affect the participant’s ability to adhere to the protocol, affect
        interpretation of the study results, or put the participant at unacceptable risk for study-related complications
        as judged by the referring clinician.  This may include a) patients with a specific acute contraindication to
        receiving ECP due to any acute condition such as new or evolving myocardial infarction or central nervous 
        system disorder, hemodynamic instability or hypovolemia, acute bleeding, respiratory distress; or b) patients
        with lupus erythematosus, porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, variegate porphyria, 
        xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism, or other dermatologic or ocular condition that contraindicates the use of 
        methoxsalen or markedly enhances photosensitivity in the investigator’s judgment.  </p>
    <p>• Aphakia or absence of ocular lenses</p>
    <p>• Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test - a urine or blood pregnancy test must be obtained within 1 week 
        prior to enrollment in women of childbearing potential)</p>
    <p>• Inability to provide informed consent or to comply with study treatments or assessments (e.g. due to 
        cognitive impairment or geographic distance) </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;"><a name="section3-6">3.6	Treatment Arm Allocation</a></p>
    <p>Patients will be electronically assigned to either the ECP Treatment Arm or to the Observation Arm of the 
        study based upon the FEV1 information entered by the site research team and the site physician’s clinical 
        judgment, as noted below.   During the study, ECP Treatment Arm enrollees will receive protocol-based ECP 
        therapy, whereas Observation Arm enrollees will not receive protocol-based ECP therapy unless crossed over 
        subsequently (see below). </p>
    <p>Once informed consent is obtained, site personnel will enter all available FEV1 values for the preceding 6 
        months (of which one FEV1 must have been obtained within the preceding 7 days) into a web-based 
        treatment allocation form which will perform an automated calculation of FEV1 slope via the linear 
        relationship of FEV1 versus time, and determine if the rate of FEV1 decline is statistically significant.  
        Patients who have had a significant rate of decline within the preceding 6 months, defined as either a) for 
        patients with FEV1 greater than 1200 mL at the time of screening, a derived FEV1 slope that is significantly 
        lower (more negative) than -30 mL/month (p less than 0.05); or b) for patients with FEV1 less than 1200 mL 
        at the time of screening, a de-rived FEV1 slope that is significantly lower (more negative) than -10 mL/month
        (p less than 0.05), will be assigned to the ECP Treatment Arm.  If a patient does not meet these criteria, he/she
        will be assigned to the Observation Arm.  However, if progressive BOS is still suspected in a patient who does
        not meet these criteria, the site investigator may obtain up to 4 additional FEV1 measurements (at intervals of
        no less than 7 days), and enter them into the web-based treatment allocation form.  The patient can be
        enrolled subsequently into the ECP Treatment Arm if a) the rate and statistical significance of FEV1 decline
        now meet the above criteria as confirmed by the web-based treatment allocation method using up to 4 
        additional FEV1 measurements; b) the site physician requests that the patient receive ECP therapy; and c) 
        the site research team confirms online that the patient has not developed a new contraindication to the use 
        of ECP therapy.  If the relationship between FEV1 and time still does not reach statistical significance after the 4 
        additional FEV1 measurements but there is strong clinical suspicion for progressive BOS, the physician may 
        still enroll the patient into the ECP Treatment Arm based on his/her clinical judgment (“clinical override”), 
        provided that the rate of FEV1 decline meets the above cut-off (-30 mL/month for patients with FEV1 greater 
        than 1200 mL or -10 mL/month for patients with FEV1 less than 1200 mL) and that the most recent FEV1 
        was obtained within the preceding 7 days.</p>
    <p>Patients who continue in the Observation Arm but who experience a decline in pulmonary function may be 
        re-evaluated for potential crossover into the ECP Treatment Arm after 2 months, using the above process and 
        criteria, as long as at least one additional FEV1 value is available within the preceding 7 days and provided 
        the patient has not developed a new contraindication to the use of ECP therapy.  Patients who cross over into 
        the ECP Treatment Arm will be followed for 1 year after the initiation of ECP.  </p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;"><a name="section3-7">3.7   Baseline and Pre-Treatment Assessments</a></p>
    <p>Upon enrollment, each patient will be informed whether he/she has been allocated to the ECP Treatment Arm 
        or to the Observation Arm (in which case he/she will not receive protocol-based ECP therapy but will be 
        followed in the study to enable assessment of the FEV-1 based treatment allocation method</p>
    <p>For all enrollees, patient demographics and co-morbidities should be entered on the case report form.   The 
        post-transplant baseline FEV1 (as defined by the standard ISHLT definition), and all FEV1 measurements 
        captured within the 6 months prior to enrollment, should be entered on the case report form.  The following 
        laboratory and procedure related information will be recorded in the case report forms for each patient in the 
        ECP Treatment Arm prior to each individual procedure or set of two scheduled procedures in any given week:</p>
    <p>1. CBC with differential and the hemocytometer used for this measurement</p>
    <p>2. The type of machine used (UVAR vs CELLEX) and confirmation that either five cycles or 1500 mL of 
        plasma have been processed, respectively.  If this did not occur, the reason why should be recorded</p>
    <p>3. The type and dose of anticoagulant used for the procedure (e.g. citrate vs heparin)</p>
    <p>Within the Washington University site only, buffy coat product specimens will be obtained in a subgroup of 
        patients on as many as three separate occasions to measure CBC with differential prior to photoactivation. </p>
    <p>Important:  a physician investigator or co-investigator must provide a signed attestation that the patient 
        meets all eligibility criteria before ECP or any other study-related invasive procedure (e.g. central venous 
        catheter placement) is performed.</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px;">6.0   ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING AND REPORTING</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"><a name="section6-4">6.4   Reporting of AE and SAE</a></p>
    <p>Patients will be monitored and followed clinically according to each site’s standard clinical practice.   Sites 
        should follow their local IRB’s guidelines in terms of reporting AEs and SAEs to the local IRB.  If an event is 
        fatal or imminently life-threatening, the local IRB should be notified within 24 hours (Monday – Friday) of 
        the research team’s knowledge of the event.   In addition, each SAE should be categorized by the site 
        investigator as to whether it was related or possibly related to participation in the research study (meaning 
        that there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by ECP – SAEs determined to be 
        solely caused by an underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject; or other circumstances unrelated 
        to the research should be categorized as not related to participation in the research).</p>
    <p>SAEs that a) are fatal or imminently life-threatening; b) are felt by the site investigator to be related or 
        possibly related to the use of ECP, to methoxsalen, or to a central venous catheter that was placed for the 
        purpose of performing ECP;  or c) occur during or within six hours after an ECP procedure must be reported 
        to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) on the SAE Case Report Form, and source documentation provided, 
        within 24 hours (Monday-Friday) of the site’s awareness of the event.   Each SAE that qualifies for reporting to 
        the DCC should also be categorized by the site investigator as to whether it was unexpected (meaning that the 
        SAE’s occurrence is not consistent with the known or foreseeable risks associated with ECP or with the 
        expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject and his/her 
        predisposing risk factor profile for the SAE), or expected.</p>
